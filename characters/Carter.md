About
------
Hi my name is Carter. I currently work for an awesome start up that just received its third round of funding. I am working with some of the newest cutting end technologies. While not at work I like to hang out at home and play PlayStation. I work from home most days and enjoy trying new restaurants and cuisines. I like to find new meetups to attend in either the tech space, or one of my other hobbies. Have any interesting ones you attend?  

*Note: I work many hours per week, so please be patient if I do not respond*
