About
------
Works for an awesome start. On the cutting edge of technologies. While not at work I like to hang out at home and play video games. I work from home most days and enjoy trying new restaurants and cuisines. I like to find new meetups to attend in either the tech space, or one of my other hobbies.
 
Makes a lot of money and never actually goes into the office. Will randomly take a Skype or Google Hangout video conference call. Best friend is Freelance Engineer
 
Moves to SF, moves into a 2 bedroom apartment and AirBnB's the other room.
