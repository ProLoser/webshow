About
------
Umm hello there.  
Yes my name is Eric. I work as a manager (doing stock) at a national eletronics store, I love my blue uniform. I get paid to make sure the things you want are on the shelf when you come in.  
  
When not at work I enjoy playing Battlefield 1942, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, and cooking meals under $10.
