Traits
------  
+ Easy Going & Laid Back
+ Hates to admit that he barely makes enough money to cover life expenses & refuses to change lifestyle to match actual income
+ Even though a simple consultant, talks about it as though its a large scale company (which ironically he would never work for). Uses royal 'we' and 'the company' as third-person reference to himself in professional manner.
