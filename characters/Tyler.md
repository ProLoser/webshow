Always broke, complains about not wanting to sell out to corporate America. Always getting job offers from StartUp engineer. Best friend is StartUp Engineer
 
Freelance consultant (previously partnered with Carter) who builds websites for individuals and companies.
  
Tyler always talks about his freelance as "The Company", and boasts about his sucesses, when it is just him. Always refers to "The Company" in third person. Tyler thinks Carter is a member of "The Company", and tries to get him back. "The Company" is his dream to never work for anyone else.
 
 
Traits
------  
+ Easy Going & Laid Back
+ Hates to admit that he barely makes enough money to cover life expenses & refuses to change lifestyle to match actual income
+ Even though a simple consultant, talks about it as though its a large scale company (which ironically he would never work for). Uses royal 'we' and 'the company' as third-person reference to himself in professional manner.
