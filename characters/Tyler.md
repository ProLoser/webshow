About
------
Hello ladies, my name is Tyler. You are welcome.  
 
I have my own consulting business where I build websites for people and companies. Not a big deal, but I do work with some pretty awesome clients, a few you have probably heard of, their managers. My awesome company allows me to make my own hours, so I am always available to listen.
