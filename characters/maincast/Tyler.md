About
------
Hello my name is Tyler, lets see... umm.. I work at a major company (you have probably heard of them) working on their website(s) as a developer. I spend most of my time outside of work with my small and growing family. We are currently working on repainting our townhouse. My wife is a massage therapist, and stays at home with our 2 year old boy.
