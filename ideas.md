Random joke ideas
=================================
  
__Managers giving code advice__  
*Premise: I always get non-coders giving me "tips" for my code.. that make no sense, 'cause they don't know code*  
  
* Developer: I can implement your request ticket, but maybe difficult because of the time constraints
* Project Manager: Nonesense, can't you just use javascript?
* Dev: I can, but..
* PM [_Interrupting_]: How about CSS jQuery?
* Dev [_Looking confused_]: That doesn't even make sense?
  
  
*Part II*  
* I want to see a HR video (like a safety video) about bad practices in code, however they have no idea what they are doing, so its basically a bunch of sinppets from movies including Office Space, Matrix, and others. As well as random screenshots and people in the office using Microsoft Word (to "code").

__Project Manager talking to developer, and giving useless statistics, when developer knows better__  
*Premise: pretty self explanatory.. it happens all too often*
  
* Project Manager: 'I think that all the buttons need to flash colors and maybe move around the screen'  
* Developer: 'No, that is a horrible idea, why would you want to do that?'  
* PM: 'Well of all the 3 people we tested with, 27.5% said that they had a hard time finding the next button, so I want to make sure ALL buttons are more visible'  
* Dev: 'I can't tell if you are joking or not...'  
* PM: 'The data does not lie friend'

__People referring to things in the most vague way possible, or incorrect terminology__  
*Premise: People are irritating when they don't specify things they are talking about*
  
*Preosn pointing at monitor and moving arm in a circular motion*
Person: "Please make that one title on the page with that one picture, larger"

__1-man Scrums__  
*Premise: Non-Tech managers love to find trending ideas/keywords and implement them blindly*

* CEO: Why is the project taking so long?
* Dev: We are week 3 into our 6 month development timeline, what do you expect?
* Dev: If you hired more developers, it would get done faster.
* CEO: Why don't you try using SCRUM?
* Dev: What? Why? That's not going to help, I am the only person in the web department.
* CEO: Lots of big successful companies use SCRUM, you should use that!
* Dev[_Looks around completely empty office_]: Look, I can have a 15 minute meeting by myself every morning if that's what you want, but it really isn't going to make me code any faster.

------

__Not asking before hiring__  
*Premise: Non-Tech managers really don't know how to hire*

* CEO: I hired you someone to help you work faster, although I don't see why you needed him
* Dev: I am not going into this again... but thank you, what is his background?
* CEO: Yea, he has a lot of experience!
* Dev: Great, is he a front end developer or backend developer?
* CEO[_pausing to think_]: He uses frontpage to code, you should see his work! It is amazing
* Dev{_pauses_]: Wait, you are serious? Please tell me you are joking with me right now
* CEO: No pull up his website: http://mixMasterFlex2001.aol.geocities.com

__Recruiters__  
*Premise: Recruiters*
  
* No real script here yet.. but thinking while everyone is together one by one they all get a phone call from the same recruiter offering the same exact job.


__Interview Questions__  
*Premise: Stupid "meta" interview questions*

* Google has interview questions like "If you were shrunk to 1/100th of your normal size and mass and placed into a blender, how would you get out?
* We could come up with assinine abstract questions and then have the interviewers scribble down completely unrelated conclusions
* Interviewer: What does the color blue smell like?
* Candidate: What? Umm.... probably like grapes? Sweet and tangy.
* [Interviewer gives questionable glares]
* [Interviewer scribbles on notepad: "Doesn't work well with teams of 2 or more"]

__How We Started__  
*Premise: Most developers started fascinated by the same things*
  
* Dev1: Flash, I hate it.. but got to admit, it got me into developing
* Dev2: What a los...wait, no you are right, I wanted to create the coolest website with flash.
* Dev1: Remember ActionScript 1?
* Dev2: Yes, I tried to get into it more, but ended up picking up HTML and not wanting to mess too much with heavy flash development
* Dev1: I made a ball bounce once. Love me some motion tweeeeen.

__Changing Tasks without consulting / Scope Creep?__  
*Premise: By the time you start/complete a task, the task basis may have changed at least 3 times*  
  
* Dev [talking to himself]: Finally can get to this task.. hmm.. style the table [starts coding task]
* PM [in meeting]: I don't like the table either! I was thinking for better UXI we need to offer a more robust color palette
* Dev [still coding]
* [2 hours pass]
* Dev: Okay, finally finished
* PM: Finished what?
* Dev: The task to style the table.
