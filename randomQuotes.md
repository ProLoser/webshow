Random Quotes we may want to use
=================================
  
  
### Managers giving code advice
*Premise: I always get non-coders giving me "tips" for my code.. that make no sense, 'cause they don't know code*  
  
* Developer: I can implement your request ticket, but maybe difficult because of the time constraints
* Project Manager: Nonesense, can't you just use javascript?
* Dev: I can, but..
* PM [_Interrupting_]: How about CSS jQuery?
* Dev [_Looking confused_]: That doesn't even make sense?

### 1-man Scrums

* CEO: Why is the project taking so long?
* Dev: It's a huge project, what do you expect?
* CEO: Why don't you try using SCRUM?
* Dev: What? Why? That's not going to help.
* CEO: Lots of big successful companies use SCRUM, you should use that!
* Dev: Look, I can have a 15 minute meeting by myself every morning if that's what you want, but it really isn't going to make me code any faster.
